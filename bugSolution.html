<p>The solution is simple: ensure that each opening tag is closed with its corresponding closing tag. In the example above, the solution would be to close the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag with <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>:</p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is a div&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>By fixing the closing tags, the HTML structure becomes valid and will render correctly.</p>
