# Uncommon HTML Error: Incorrect Element Closing Tags

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error that can be easily overlooked.  The error occurs when closing HTML elements with the wrong tags. While common to mis-close tags, the specific scenario presented might be less frequently encountered.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

This error can lead to unexpected rendering behavior in browsers and will often fail validation checks.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
2. Observe the unexpected rendering or browser console errors.
3. Compare it with `bugSolution.html` to see the correct implementation.
